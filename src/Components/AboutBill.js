						It was an easy image.. I remember it clearly.Just a black filled- in
						pointy thing.No frills. My material got lighter with time - thank
						goodness- and after about 20 years it gave me a living.First in
						advertising then syndicating material through the Press Association
						to provincial newspapers in Britain . I also syndicated to the
						English- speaking world:Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India.An
						agent in the US got my work into South and Central America. This is
						all pre- digital age. If I ever find any thing from that time Iâ€™ll
						put it up here.The Daily Star launched in 1978 with me as
						cartoonist.Later I worked for the Sunday Mail in Scotland, the Sun
						and several magazines.These days I enjoy working for the Church
						Times and Yachting Monthly. Boats I know about. Church not so much
						but they show great patience with this heretic on board giving a
						bitof balance
